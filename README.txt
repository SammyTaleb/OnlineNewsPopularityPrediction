###### JUPYTER NOTEBOOK ######
To view the jupyter notebook, you can open the .ipynb file or run the API and go to the url:
http:/localhost:5000/notebook

###### TO RUN THE API #######
Start by cloning the github into your own directory. As the model files .pkl are very heavy, I was not able to push them on github.
Please run the file 'models.py' to get the .pkl files containing each model.
You can then open a IPython Console, move to the 'API Flask' Directory and run the command:
python app.py go to the localhost URL to see the API.

###### POWERPOINT ####### 
The Powerpoint presentation, gathers all important information and process details of the dataset analysis 
and the models building.
